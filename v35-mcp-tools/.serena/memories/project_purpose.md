This project, 'v35-mcp-tools', is a Master Control Program (MCP) for the Trinitas AI agent system. It serves as a sophisticated backend that manages, coordinates, and enhances AI agents.

Key purposes include:
- Providing a suite of native tools for AI agents to use via a server.
- Managing different execution modes, allowing agents to run on various backends like local LLMs or cloud-based models (e.g., Claude).
- Orchestrating complex workflows involving multiple agents and tasks.
- Ensuring production-grade performance, monitoring, and stability through advanced features like caching, session management, and health checks.
