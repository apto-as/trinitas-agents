The codebase follows modern Python conventions, emphasizing clarity, type safety, and maintainability.

- **Formatting:** The presence of `ruff_results.json` and `black` in `requirements.txt` suggests that an automated formatter (likely `ruff format` or `black`) is used to maintain a consistent style.
- **Typing:** The code extensively uses Python's type hints (`str`, `int`, `Dict`, `Optional`, etc.). This is enforced by `mypy`, which is listed in the dependencies.
- **Docstrings:** Functions and classes generally have clear docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
- **Modularity:** The code is highly modular, with distinct features like caching, session management, and monitoring separated into their own files.
- **Configuration:** Configuration is managed through environment variables (defined in `.env.example` and loaded at runtime), which is a best practice for separating config from code.
- **Naming:** Naming conventions appear to follow PEP 8 standards (e.g., `snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for classes).
