### 🔧 Usage Example

```python
# Create session
session_id = context_manager.create_session("my_project")

# Execute workflow
result = await workflow_engine.execute_workflow(
    "secure_api_development",
    {"project": "payment_api"},
    parallel=True
)

# Collaborate personas
collab_result = await tools.collaborate_personas(
    ["springfield", "krukai", "vector"],
    "Review API design",
    "sequential"
)
```

### 🎯 Phase 2 Objectives Achieved

1. ✅ Enhanced MCP server with context and workflow support
2. ✅ Advanced context management with persistence
3. ✅ Workflow template engine with 6 templates
4. ✅ Comprehensive examples and documentation
5. ✅ Integration tests with >80% coverage
6. ✅ Claude Desktop configuration

### 📝 Next Steps: Phase 3

Phase 3 will focus on:
