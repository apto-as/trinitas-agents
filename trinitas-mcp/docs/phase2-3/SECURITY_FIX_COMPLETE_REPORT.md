## 🚀 Security Improvements Achieved

### 🔒 **Before Fix**
```python
# VULNERABLE - Information disclosure risk
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Database failed: {str(e)}")  # ⚠️ EXPOSES SENSITIVE DATA
    return {"error": str(e)}                    # ⚠️ LEAKS INTERNAL INFO
```

### ✅ **After Fix** 
```python
# SECURE - Protected error handling
except Exception as e:
    error_id = secure_log_error(e, "database_operation")  # 🔒 SECURE LOGGING
    logger.error(f"Database failed: [{error_id}]")        # 🔒 SAFE MESSAGE
    return {"error": get_secure_error_message(e)}         # 🔒 SANITIZED RESPONSE
```
